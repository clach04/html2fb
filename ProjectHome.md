Python library and tools to convert from html file into FictionBook  2 (XML) format. Command line and GUI version. Check out the GettingStarted guide.

See http://haali.cs.msu.ru/pocketpc/FictionBook_description.html for more information on FictionBook format. For other input formats (non-html) consider taking a look at http://code.google.com/p/ooofbtools/ which uses Open Office (which provides support for many more input formats).

Thanks to Alexander I. Evseev who wrote the initial version of the [h2fb](http://altline.ru/~e-ai/h2fb_about.shtml) script, Alexander has handed over support of the library to me so please use the Issues tab for reporting problems.

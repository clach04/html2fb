# Introduction #

FictionBook is a single file XML based ebook format. The current version is version 2. You need an ebook reader to read fb2 format (or a converter to convert from fb2 to something else). More information on fb2http://haali.cs.msu.ru/pocketpc/FictionBook\_description.html

# Viewing FictionBook ebooks #

Lots of different viewers/converters. Most are win32 only but there are a few exceptions.

## Viewers ##

  * Haali Reader - excellent Windows (desktop and PDA) based viewer http://haali.cs.msu.ru/pocketpc/index.html.en. The built in dictionary support is fantastic and you can easily create a version of Webster/OPTED (http://msowww.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/) using the provided mkdict tool
  * FBreader cross platform but not PocketPC :-(

## Converters (to and from) ##

  * Any to FB2 -- not bad, win32 only (source is in Delphi so with some work you may be able to run this under Linux via Kylix or even http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org http://www.freepascal.org/ ) http://www.gribuser.ru/xml/fictionbook/index.html.en
  * http://haali.cs.msu.ru/pocketpc/files/html2xml.pl -- I've not had much success getting clean conversions with this tool
  * bunch of different XSL files http://www.gribuser.ru/xml/fictionbook/2.0/xsl/export/
  * http://code.google.com/p/fb2pdf/ (note I've not used this)
